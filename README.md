# Class Activity: Using a LinkedList

This class activity is designed to help you understand how to use a LinkedList in Java and how to create unit tests to ensure your code is working correctly.

## Overview

The project is about creating a `MovieImpl` class that implements a `Movie` interface. The `Movie` interface represents a movie with a title, director, and year of release. The `MovieImpl` class is used to store these details.

The `Main` class reads movie data from a CSV file, converts each line into a `Movie` object, and adds it to a LinkedList. It then prints out the list of movies and a list of movies made in a specific year.

## Instructions

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project in IntelliJ IDEA 2023.3.1 or any other IDE that supports Java.
3. Navigate to the `src/movies/MovieImpl.java` file and implement the methods defined in the `Movie` interface.
4. Once you have implemented the `MovieImpl` class, navigate to the `test/MovieImplTest.java` file.
5. Run the unit tests in `MovieImplTest.java` to ensure your `MovieImpl` class is working correctly.

## Requirements

- You should have a basic understanding of Java, LinkedLists, and unit testing.
- You should have IntelliJ IDEA 2023.3.1 or any other IDE that supports Java installed on your machine.

## Note

Remember, the goal of this activity is to understand how to use LinkedLists in Java. If you encounter any issues, don't hesitate to ask for help.

Happy coding!
